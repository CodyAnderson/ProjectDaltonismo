  1: Problem
    1.1: CVD
  2: Solution
    2.2: Constraints
      2.2.1: Compensate for CVD
        2.2.1.1: Daltonization
      2.2.2: On modern hardware
        2.2.2.1: HDMI
      2.2.3: In real (enough) time
        2.2.3.1: FPGA
      2.2.4: Potential ability to use custom CVD types
        2.2.4.1: More than just a lookup table
  3: Daltonization
    3.1: How to
      3.1.1: Simulate sufferers' CVD
      3.1.2: Find difference between CVD and full color
      3.1.3: Negate difference and add back to original color
      3.1.4: Project colors back into sufferers' visible spectrum
  4: HDMI
    4.1: All devices have HDMI these days
    4.2: TMDS
    4.3: Audio
      4.3.1: Pretend it doesn't exist, fuck THAT shit
  5: FPGA
    5.1: Allows for many unique operations to be done simultaneously
    5.2: Delays lower than a frame time
    5.3: Takes NO compute time and adds no additional load away from an existing CPU/GPU
  6: More than just a lookup table
    6.1: TBD
